# Movie-Recommendation-Netflix
Since the pandemic OTT Platforms like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime have gained a lot of popularity when it comes to shows and Movies. 
Due to their immense usage, platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime now make their own movies and shoes. To study the impact that these platforms have on people,
I wanted to analyze Netflix data including all its movies and shows, and come up with a recommending system to help users pick out movies and shows according to the 
content they already like!
